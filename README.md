Josh Kelseys Code
The matlab capstone folder contains a program that simulates the initial prototype of my senior project.
The protoype was designed to harvest energy from the motion of a persons knee joint using a dual action cylinder.
The cylinder would intake air, compress it, and then store it for future use in a storage tank.
The code simulates the process of starting with an empty tank and slowly pressurizing it. 
The purpose of this code was to see how many strides a person would take to obtain a working 
pressure based on using a low profile piston cylinder.


The python folder contains a script and text file. When the program is run the user will be prompted to enter the text file.
The program simulates a vending machine and the amount of money a person has left to spend.
